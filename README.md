### README

I thought I could not get any nerdier than making [`spaceMovie`](https://github.com/butterflyology/spaceMovie) but I think this may beat it.

I applied the tools of community ecology to the music of the *Star Wars* films. Other people undertook the main effort to compile the counts for each time a theme was played in each of the seven films.
