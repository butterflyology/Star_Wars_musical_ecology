### README

I thought I could not get any nerdier than making [`spaceMovie`](https://github.com/butterflyology/spaceMovie) but I think this may beat it.

I applied the tools of community ecology to the music of the *Star Wars* films. Other people undertook the main effort to compile the counts for each time a theme was played in each of the seven films.

Files:

* `/code/SW_me.Rmd` - The `RMarkdown` file that contains the script to generate the analyses and figures.
* `/data/DWC_theme_tracker.csv` - The spreadsheet in (comma separated value format) based off the work of [David W. Collins](https://twitter.com/DavidWCollins?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).
